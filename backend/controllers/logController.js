// log functions that will run inside the request, response cycle
// capture username, user IP, current date & time, total requests counter, request method & request path

// checkTotalRequests per session && per 24h 
// we want to check the total requests made & measure the request count over a 24h period
    // if the user makes over 1000 requests within a single session || 24 h period
    // then calculate the time remaining (24h cycle)
    // restrict user access rights & permissions for the remaining time
